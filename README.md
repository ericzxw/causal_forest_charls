In this task, I try to examine the heterougenous effect of social participation on respondents cognitive score.

Cognitive score is composed by four categories:
- orient
- word_recall
- draw
- serial 7'

Social participation is referred as "sp" in the dataset and has binary values: 0 or 1.

For covariates, please refer to the R file for details
